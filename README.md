Programming a robotic arm with Arduino and servo.

### A little video
here : [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uer5jBOqY-g&ab_channel=ErwannBreal)  

## 3D print
You can visit all 3D files in thingeverse : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3094794  
or simply download in "3D-files" on my github.  

## The first program -> ClassicMouvement.ino
This programme enables the arm to pick up the cube and place it in a cup.  
This action is performed at the touch of a button.  
you can find it in the "code" file

## The secondly program -> MultipleMouvement.ino
This programme doesn't just put the cube in the cup (see youtube video) The arm will make a multitude of movements, but only one of them will put the cube in the cup.
